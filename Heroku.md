# Heroku gives apps a place to live on the Internet. Much the way a website host puts your site up on the Web and keeps it 
running using its own servers, Heroku puts an app you’ve developed on the Internet for others to use. With a few clicks you
can “deploy” your app, thus making it possible for others to find and load into their browsers the same way they’d load a Web site.


## How Heroku Works:
When you create an app on Heroku, it deploys to the Cedar Stack, an online runtime environment that supports apps built in Java, 
Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python and PHP—all the programming languages that Heroku supports.

## Heroku And Git:
One of the reasons Heroku is easy for people to use is that it relies on a widely used revision control system—that is, a way of managing 
the program code for your app—called Git.
