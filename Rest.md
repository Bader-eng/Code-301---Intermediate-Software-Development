## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team:
* Like most 25-year-olds, Julia Rozovsky wasn’t sure what she wanted to do with her life. She had worked at a consulting firm, 
but it wasn’t a good match. Then she became a researcher for two professors at Harvard, which was interesting but lonely. Maybe 
a big corporation would be a better fit. Or perhaps a fast-growing start-up. All she knew for certain was that she wanted to find 
a job that was more social. ‘‘I wanted to be part of a community, part of something people were building together,’’ she told me. 
She thought about various opportunities — Internet companies, a Ph.D. program — but nothing seemed exactly right. So in 2009, 
she chose the path that allowed her to put off making a decision: She applied to business schools and was accepted by the Yale School of Management.

* Every day, between classes or after dinner, Rozovsky and her four teammates gathered to discuss homework assignments,
compare spreadsheets and strategize for exams. Everyone was smart and curious, and they had a lot in common: They had gone to similar
colleges and had worked at analogous firms. These shared experiences, Rozovsky hoped, would make it easy for them to work well together.
But it didn’t turn out that way. ‘‘There are lots of people who say some of their best business-school friends come from their 
study groups,’’ Rozovsky told me. ‘‘It wasn’t like that for me.’’

## HTTP :
* The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol for distributed, 
collaborative, hypermedia information systems.HTTP is the foundation of data communication 
for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources
that the user can easily access.

## Rest:
* Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style which uses a subset of HTTPIt is 
commonly used to create interactive applications that use Web services. A Web service that follows these guidelines is called RESTful.
