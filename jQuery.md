## Query is :
* a fast small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, 
animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and 
extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

1. .add() :Create a new jQuery object with elements added to the set of matched elements.

2. .addBack: Add the previous set of elements on the stack to the current set, optionally filtered by a selector.
3. addClass: Adds the specified class(es) to each element in the set of matched elements.
4. after: Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements.

## Why pair program?

* While learning to code, developers likely study several programming languages. Similar to a foreign language class, there are four fundamental skills 
 that help anyone learn a new language: Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary Speaking: using the correct words to communicate 
 an idea Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful

* Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’
  guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.
  
  1. Greater efficiency: It is a common misconception that pair programming takes a lot longer and is less efficient. In reality, when two people 
  focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes in the making. Research indicates that pair programing takes slightly longer, 
  but produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging (let alone exposing users to a broken product).
  
  2. Engaged collaboration : When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused 
  than if they were working alone. It is harder to procrastinate or get off track when someone else is relying on you to complete the work.
